# Sorting grounds

I'm lacking lots of academic knowledge, so i'm replenishing my
intelligence! Today's target is sorting algorithms.

## Building

```
<your compiler> src/main.c -o target/executable
# or just
make 
```

## Playing

```
target/executable
target/executable [test data length...]
target/executable 100 100000 10000000
```
